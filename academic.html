        <h2>Academic Life Overview</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to engage in various research projects. I love writing essays, so I enjoyed writing every single one. Some of them were about linguistics, but most were literature related. Moreover, I am currently an intern at the writing center, working on publishing my work, and writing my capstone!</p>

        <h2>Current Research Projects</h2>
        <h3>Project 1: What’s in a question? Tutoring Technique through the Lens of Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy <i> working on publishing</i></h3>
        <p>In this research, I am exploring Bloom's Taxonomy, which is a framework for education centered around cognitive skills created in 1956. The research project is about analyzing writing consultations conducted by writing fellows of different levels and experiences, focusing on what kinds of questions they ask during consultations to see to what extent they use them for higher-order cognitive skills, as the pedagogy they are being trained in suggests, and which higher-order skills they tend to focus on the most. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the tutoring practices of peer tutors in training at our university. It will also provide important empirical evidence about those practices in a Central Asian context, which is currently lacking in the writing center studies literature. </p>

        <h3>Project 2: West vs East Literature: Views on World War II by Alexievich and Terkel <i> capstone project unfinished</i></h3>
        <p>In my capstone project I am reading two oral history books written by a Belarussian and an American writer about WWII. I am comparing both to see how they view the WWII, and what kind of details impact how they write about such a tragic event. Moreover, I am also paying attention to how their interviewees act and talk about the WWII which they participated in. </p>
