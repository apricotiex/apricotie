        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When one has leisure time, hobbies are ideal. Hobbies are something that everyone should pursue in order to become a better version of themselves. An activity might occupy a tiny portion of your time or develop into your life completely. Hobbies may grow into something larger and better, such as a profession. However, this should not always be the aim. Hobbies are merely something to do when one is feeling lost or weary of the actual world. Some of my interests have become sacred to me and have become my life, but others have come and gone.</p>

        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <p>As Billy Joel said, "Music in in itself is healing". Music is like waves of magic which flow through your body and take control of your emotions. Music has the ability to make you ecstatic, melancholy, frustrated, amused, peaceful, and restless. It is quite intriguing. It is increasingly common to have playlists for every mood you experience. I have playlists with classical music for studying, soothing and peaceful music for falling asleep, and loud music for when I'm feeling upbeat. In grade 7, I began studying to play the guitar after discovering my love for music. Whenever I have a spare moment, I immediately begin looking for new solos or riffs to learn. Undoubtedly, I still have room for improvement, but it does not diminish my love for the guitar.</p>

        <h2>Painting</h2>
        <p>A work of art may be considered garbage by one person and a masterpiece by another. That is what I find most appealing about art. Not everyone sees the same thing as you do since everyone relates the art piece to their own past and sees something unique.
            I have loved art for as long as I can remember. I have always asked for new paints or pencils for any holiday possible. Nowadays I put on Bob Ross and paint alongside him whenever I get spontaneous bursts of inspiration. I particularly enjoy looking at oil paintings. The way that each stroke is depicted on a canvas, embellishing it with hues and giving it an irregular surface.</p>

        <h2>Crafts</h2>
        <p>Books are like universes concealed behind two covers and silently placed on a shelf among hundreds of other worlds. They have the ability to transport the reader to a new universe, a new existence, and to imagine the story as if it were a movie. I spent much of my childhood at the library, looking for a book I hadn't read yet. My table was stacked high with Geronimo Stilton and Poison Apple novels. But my love of literature blossomed into something more. I am currently majoring in WLLC, and I am confident that my love of reading and writing had a significant impact in my decision..</p>

        <p>Just like my parents, I am obsessed with movies and shows. Hence, I created a list of my favorite shows (not movies) in grade 7. I also add my own rating! <a href="netflix.html">Netflix recommendations</a>!</p>
