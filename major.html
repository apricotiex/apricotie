        <h2>Importance of My Major</h2>
        <p>Learning literaure might seem easy and unimportant in the modern world, however, only people who know nothing about literature say that. Literature provides insights about history, historical periods when a work was written, it creates masterpieces. A work feels like a canvas and you need to study every brush stroke. Literautre will love you if you love literature. For example, when I was not as interested in my major I thought the field was very limited, with only a few literary theories and only a few interesting works. However, if you dive deeper, you'll be rewared. For instance, the theory of emplotment, created by Hayden White, proves that even historical books are considered fiction. Why? Because historians, just like writers, make an interesting story out of mere facts. Literature is needed and will always be needed. Otherwise what will happen to our society if we forget famous writers and ignore the ones that already exist? What if Shakespear was never acknowledged?</p>

        <h3>What's Popular and What's Not</h3>
        <p>Todayâ€™s literature features diverse voices and blends genres, making stories more unique. Mental health and climate change are popular themes, resonating with readers. Historical fiction continues to engage audiences by revealing lesser-known stories. Young adult literature tackles issues of identity and social justice, while graphic novels and narrative non-fiction are also gaining popularity.</p>
