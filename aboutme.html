        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was borin the city of Kostanay in 2003. I am a very artistic person, just like my family. I enjoy oil painting, playing the guitar, reading non-fiction, and crafts. I am a senior at Nazarbayev University and this is my first time diving deeper into html and css. I find it quite difficult yet extremely intruiging! I hope you enjoy looking through my website! P.S. It is fall themed because I am creating it in fall, my favorite season is fall, and my birthday is in fall.</p>
